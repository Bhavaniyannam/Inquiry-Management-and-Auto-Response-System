Problem Statement:

Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis
•	Requirement Gathering: Identify and document the key needs and challenges from all stakeholders.
•	Stakeholder Analysis:
o	Sales/support team (high interaction with customers)
o	Managers (monitoring metrics and team performance)
o	IT/Admin (system maintenance)
•	Business Process Mapping: Document the current flow: Customer inquiry → Manual logging → Follow-up → Resolution.
•	Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis: For example, a college receives course inquiries via website forms; Salesforce logs each inquiry, sends an instant “Thank you, we’ll respond soon,” and routes to admissions staff.
•	AppExchange Exploration: Explore lead/inquiry management apps for possible extensions or templates.
